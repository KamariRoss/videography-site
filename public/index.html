        It all started when I wanted to go beyond capturing still images. I
        thought "There has to be something more to this photography stuff". So I
        searched the internet and found a wealth of information about capturing
        moving images.

        I am not a professional, but I am still learning. I found a wealth of
        information on the art and science of the craft and I am still eager to
        learn and grow with the community in tampa. I hope to progress and and
        make short films for festivals, social media and YouTube.
